### Project Title: ISO 27001 Compliant Incident Management Simulation with Kali Linux

### Objective:
To simulate an incident response using Kali Linux tools, aligning with ISO 27001 standards for systematic security incident management.
This project setup allows students to gain hands-on experience with powerful tools within Kali Linux, enhancing their understanding of practical incident management in a cybersecurity context.

### Tools Needed:
- Kali Linux with VirtualBox
- Network simulation tools pre-installed on Kali Linux (e.g., Wireshark for network analysis, Snort as an IDS)
- Incident report template (aligned with ISO 27001)
- ISO 27001 checklist for incident response

### Preparation:
1. **Briefing on ISO 27001 and Kali Tools:**
   - Provide an overview of ISO 27001 standards relevant to incident management.
   - Introduce key Kali Linux tools that will be used in the simulation, focusing on their roles and capabilities in incident detection and response.

2. **Environment Setup:**
   - Ensure all students have Kali Linux running in VirtualBox with necessary tools installed.
   - Prepare a controlled network environment within VirtualBox where traffic can be monitored and incidents can be simulated.

### Scenario:
As part of the IT security team at a simulated company, you've detected suspicious activities through your IDS (Snort) indicating possible unauthorized access attempts. Your task is to manage this incident in compliance with ISO 27001 standards.

### Instructions:
1. **Incident Detection using Kali Tools:**
   - Use Wireshark to capture and analyze network traffic.
   - Use Snort to monitor real-time traffic and generate alerts for suspicious activities.

2. **Initial Response:**
   - Follow the ISO 27001 checklist for immediate actions, such as isolating the affected system.
   - Utilize network management commands in Kali Linux to control traffic and access.

3. **Documentation:**
   - Record all findings and actions in the incident report template.
   - Ensure documentation is detailed, adhering to ISO 27001 standards.

4. **Assessment and Decision Making:**
   - Evaluate the severity and impact of the incident using the data collected.
   - Decide on recovery strategies and any need for escalation.

5. **Resolution and Recovery:**
   - Implement remediation steps using Kali Linux tools.
   - Restore systems to operational status, ensuring no lingering threats.

6. **Review and Continuous Improvement:**
   - Conduct a post-incident review using the documented reports.
   - Discuss improvement in processes and strategies for future incident handling.

### Debrief:
Engage students in a discussion to review their response processes, focusing on their practical application of Kali Linux tools, adherence to ISO 27001 standards, and critical thinking in managing the incident.

### Assessment:
Evaluate students based on their practical use of Kali Linux tools, adherence to ISO 27001 protocols, quality of their incident documentation, and insights during the debriefing session.
